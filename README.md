A very simple Rust library to get the manufacturer of a specific MAC address

## Getting Started

### Installation

If you want to use this library for one of your projects, you can install it like any other Rust crate

```bash
cargo add rsmanuf
```

If you want to have the online indexing method to always use the most up to date version of the [`manuf.txt`](./src/manuf.txt) file, you need to install it with the `online` feature:

```bash
cargo add rsmanuf --features online
```

### Example Usage

To get a manufacturer, you simply need to do the following

```rust
fn main() {
    let index = rsmanuf::Index::new();
    match index.search("C4:A8:1D:73:D7:8C") {
        Ok(manuf) => {
            println!("Manufacturer: {}", manuf)
        }
        Err(error) => {
            println!("Error: {}", error)
        }
    }
}
```

To get a manufacturer by using the online index (the **`online`** feature needs to be enabled), do the following

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut index = rsmanuf::online::Index::new();
    match index.search("C4:A8:1D:73:D7:8C") {
        Ok(manuf) => {
            println!("Manufacturer: {}", manuf)
        }
        Err(error) => {
            println!("Error: {}", error)
        }
    }
}
```
